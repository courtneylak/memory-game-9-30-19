## Instructions

Simply click on any of the randomly shuffled 16 icon cards to begin the timer and begin the game. Click on another card to see if it matches with the first one--if so, user gets 'one' match score point in the score panel above. The objective is to make as many matches as possible in the least amount of time to retain a high 3-star rating (too much time thinking or memorizing will diminish the star-rating performance matrix.)

To restart or refresh the game, simply hit the 'restart' icon at the top.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
